# Reason for This Repository

This repository is intended to collect primary source historical legal materials in one place. These materials often exist in multiple places in the physical and digital worlds. As historical materials, they usually originate in print. 

Digitization efforts have brought these materials into cyberspace. Google is best known for this. However, these documents are not really structured in any meaningful way. For example, one seeking to find all volumes of the United States Reports, the bound volumes in which United States Supreme Court opinions appear, will find it difficult to locate each individual volume, even when searching with "volume [number]" in quotation marks. I am unsure why this is the case.

Legal database companies may digitize these materials and place their content into their proprietary system, which they then charge exorbinant fees to access. In any event, PDF scans of the printed documents are not available. Unfortunately, the prudent reader will come across what appears to be a typographical error every now and then. Without the original PDF document against which to compare the digital rendering, one cannot in good conscience quote such database material.

Some states have digitized various portions of their session laws, supreme court opinions, and other items, and made the PDFs available for no charge. These efforts should be applauded. While nearly all states now have contemporaneous material in digital form, how far back such material goes differs widely between states.

These problems collectively boil down to this: digitized legal material exists in various, decentralized, and unpredictable places online. The purpose of this repository is to collect this scattered material in one centralized place.
