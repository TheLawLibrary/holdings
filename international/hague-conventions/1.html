    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc">Title I. On the Maintenance of the General Peace.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc">Article 1</p>
    <p>With a view to obviating, as far as possible, resource to force in the relations between States, the Signatory Powers agree to use their best efforts to insure the pacific settlement of international differences.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc">Title II. On Good Offices and Mediation</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc">Article 2</p>
    <p>In case of serious disagreement or conflict, before an appeal to arms, the Signatory Powers agree to have recourse, as far as circumstances allow, to the good offices or mediation of one or more friendly Powers.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc">Article 3</p>
    <p>Independently of this recourse, the Signatory Powers recommend that one or more Powers, strangers to the dispute, should, on their own initiative, and <b><i>**235</i></b> as far as circumstances may allow, offer their good offices or mediation to the States at variance.</p>
    <p>Powers, stranger to the dispute, have the right to offer good offices or mediation, even during the course of hostilities.</p>
    <p>The exercise of this right can never be regarded by one or the other of the parties in conflict as an unfriendly act.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc">Article 4</p>
    <p>The part of the mediator consists in reconciling the opposing claims and appeasing the feelings of resentment which may have arisen between the States at variance.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc">Article 5</p>
    <p>The functions of the mediator are at an end when once it is declared, either by one of the parties to the dispute, or by the mediator himself, that the means of reconciliation proposed by him are not accepted.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc">Article 6</p>
    <p>Good offices and mediation, either at the request of the parties at variance, or on the initiative of Powers strangers to the dispute, have exclusively the character of advice and never have binding force.</p>
