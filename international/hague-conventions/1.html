    <p>Who, after communication of their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed on the following provisions:</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="tit1">Title I. On the Maintenance of the General Peace.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art1">Article 1</p>
    <p>With a view to obviating, as far as possible, resource to force in the relations between States, the Signatory Powers agree to use their best efforts to insure the pacific settlement of international differences.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="tit2">Title II. On Good Offices and Mediation</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art2">Article 2</p>
    <p>In case of serious disagreement or conflict, before an appeal to arms, the Signatory Powers agree to have recourse, as far as circumstances allow, to the good offices or mediation of one or more friendly Powers.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art3">Article 3</p>
    <p>Independently of this recourse, the Signatory Powers recommend that one or more Powers, strangers to the dispute, should, on their own initiative, and <span id="p235"><b><i>**235</i></b></span> as far as circumstances may allow, offer their good offices or mediation to the States at variance.</p>
    <p>Powers, stranger to the dispute, have the right to offer good offices or mediation, even during the course of hostilities.</p>
    <p>The exercise of this right can never be regarded by one or the other of the parties in conflict as an unfriendly act.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art4">Article 4</p>
    <p>The part of the mediator consists in reconciling the opposing claims and appeasing the feelings of resentment which may have arisen between the States at variance.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art5">Article 5</p>
    <p>The functions of the mediator are at an end when once it is declared, either by one of the parties to the dispute, or by the mediator himself, that the means of reconciliation proposed by him are not accepted.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art6">Article 6</p>
    <p>Good offices and mediation, either at the request of the parties at variance, or on the initiative of Powers strangers to the dispute, have exclusively the character of advice and never have binding force.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art7">Article 7</p>
    <p>The acceptance of mediation can not, unless there be an agreement to the contrary, have the effect of interrupting, delaying, or hindering mobilization or other measures of preparation for war.</p>
    <p>If mediation, occurs after the commencement of hostilities it causes no interruption to the military operations in progress, unless there be an agreement to the contrary.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art8">Article 8</p>
    <p>The Signatory Powers are agreed in recommending the application, when circumstances allow, of special mediation in the following form:</p>
    <p>In case of a serious difference endangering the peace, the States at variance choose respectively a Power, to whom they intrust the mission of entering into direct communication with the Power chosen on the other side, with the object of preventing the rupture of pacific relations.</p>
    <p>For the period of this mandate, the term of which, unless otherwise stipulated, cannot exceed thirty days, the States in conflict cease from all direct communication on the subject of the dispute, which is regarded as referred exclusively to the mediating Powers, who must use their best efforts to settle it.</p>
    <p>In case of a definite rupture of pacific relations, these Powers are charged with the joint task of taking advantage of any opportunity to restore peace.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="tit3"><span id="p236"><b><i>**236</i></b></span> Title III. On International Commissions of Inquiry</p>
    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art9">Article 9</p>
    <p>In differences of an international nature involving neither honour nor vital interests, and arising from a difference of opinion on points of fact, the Signatory Powers recommend that the parties, who have not been able to come to an agreement by means of diplomacy, should as far as circumstances allow, institute an International Commission of Inquiry, to facilitate a solution of these differences by elucidating the facts by means of an impartial and conscientious investigation.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art10">Article 10</p>
    <p>The International Commissions of Inquiry are constituted by special agreement between the parties in conflict.</p>
    <p>The Convention for an inquiry defines the facts to be examined and the extent of the Commissioners&rsquo; powers.</p>
    <p>It settles the procedure.</p>
    <p>On the inquiry both sides must be heard.</p>
    <p>The form and the periods to be observed, if not stated in the inquiry Convention, are decided by the Commission itself.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art11">Article 11</p>
    <p>The International Commissions of Inquiry are formed, unless otherwise stipulated, in the manner fixed by Article 32 of the present convention.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art12">Article 12</p>
    <p>The powers in dispute engage to supply the International Commission of Inquiry, as fully as they may think possible, with all means and facilities necessary to enable it to be completely acquainted with and to accurately understand the facts in question.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art13">Article 13</p>
    <p>The International Commission of Inquiry communicates its Report to the conflicting Powers, signed by all the members of the Commission.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art14">Article 14</p>
    <p>The report of the International Commission of Inquiry is limited to a statement of facts, and has in no way the character of an Arbitral Award. It leaves the conflicting Powers entire freedom as to the effect to be given to this statement.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="tit4">Title IV. On International Arbitration</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center" id="ch1"><span class="sc">Chapter I.</span> <i>On the System of Arbitration</i></p>
    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art15">Article 15</p>
    <p>International arbitration has for its object the settlement of differences between States by judges of their own choice, and on the basis of respect for law.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art16"><span id="p237"><b><i>**237</i></b></span> Article 16</p>
    <p>In questions of a legal nature, and especially in the interpretation or application of International Conventions, arbitration is recognized by the Signatory Powers as the most effective, and at the same time the most equitable, means of settling disputes which diplomacy has failed to settle.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art17">Article 17</p>
    <p>The Arbitration Convention is concluded for questions already existing or for questions which may arise eventually.</p>
    <p>It may embrace any dispute or only disputes of a certain category.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art18">Article 18</p>
    <p>The Arbitration Convention implies the engagement to submit loyally to the Award.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art19">Article 19</p>
    <p>Independently of general or private Treaties expressly stipulating recourse to arbitration as obligatory on the Signatory Powers, these Powers reserve to themselves the right of concluding, either before the ratification of the present Act or later, new Agreements, general or private, with a view to extending obligatory arbitration to all cases which they may consider it possible to submit to it.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" id="ch2"><span class="sc">Chapter II.</span> <i>On the Permanent Court of Arbitration</i></p>
    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art20">Article 20</p>
    <p>With the object of facilitating an immediate recourse to arbitration for international differences, which it has not been possible to settle by diplomacy, the Signatory Powers undertake to organize a permanent Court of Arbitration, accessible at all times and operating, unless otherwise stipulated by the parties, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure inserted in the present convention.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art21">Article 21</p>
    <p>The Permanent Court shall be competent for all arbitration cases, unless the parties agree to institute a special Tribunal.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art22">Article 22</p>
    <p>An International Bureau, established by The Hague, serves as record office for the Court.</p>
    <p>This Bureau is the channel for communications relative to the meetings of the Court.</p>
    <p>It has the custody of the archives and conducts all the administrative business.</p>
    <p>The Signatory Powers undertake to communicate to the International Bureau at The Hague a duly certified copy of any conditions of arbitration <span id="p238"><b><i>**238</i></b></span> arrived at between them, and of any award concerning them delivered by special Tribunals.</p>
    <p>They undertake also to communicate to the Bureau the Laws, Regulations, and documents eventually showing the execution of the awards given by the Court.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art23">Article 23</p>
    <p>Within the three months following its ratification of the present Act, each Signatory Power shall select four persons at the most, of known competency in questions of international law, of the highest moral reputation, and disposed to accept the duties of Arbitrators.</p>
    <p>The persons thus selected shall be inscribed, as members of the Court, in a list which shall be notified by the Bureau to all the Signatory Powers.</p>
    <p>Any alteration in the list of Arbitrators is brought by the Bureau to the knowledge of the Signatory Powers.</p>
    <p>Two or more Powers may agree on the selection in common of one or more Members.</p>
    <p>The same person can be selected by different Powers.</p>
    <p>The Members of the Court are appointed for a term of six years. Their appointments can be renewed.</p>
    <p>In case of the death or retirement of a member of the Court, his place shall be filled in accordance with the method of his appointment.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art24">Article 24</p>
    <p>When the Signatory Powers desire to have recourse to the Permanent Court for the settlement of a difference that has arisen between them, the Arbitrators called upon to form the competent Tribunal to decide this difference, must be chosen from the general list of members of the Court.</p>
    <p>Failing the direct agreement of the parties on the composition of the Arbitration Tribunal, the following course shall be pursued:</p>
    <p>Each party appoints two Arbitrators, and these together choose an Umpire.</p>
    <p>If the votes are equal, the choice of the Umpire is intrusted to a third Power, selected by the parties by common accord.</p>
    <p>If an agreement is not arrived at on this subject, each party selects a different Power, and the choice of the Umpire is made in concert by the Powers thus selected.</p>
    <p>The Tribunal being thus composed, the parties notify to the Bureau their determination to have recourse to the Court and the names of the Arbitrators.</p>
    <p>The Tribunal of Arbitration assembles on the date fixed by the parties.</p>
    <p>The Members of the Court, in the discharge of their duties and out of their own country, enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art25">Article 25</p>
    <p>The Tribunal of Arbitration has its ordinary seat at The Hague.</p>
    <p>Except in cases of necessity, the place of session can only be altered by the Tribunal with the assent of the parties.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art26"><span id="p239"><b><i>**239</i></b></span> Article 26</p>
    <p>The International Bureau at The Hague is authorized to place its premises and its staff at the disposal of the Signatory Powers for the operations of any special Board of Arbitration.</p>
    <p>The jurisdiction of the Permanent Court, may, within the conditions laid down in the Regulations, be extended to disputes between non-Signatory Powers, or between Signatory Powers and non-Signatory Powers, if the parties are agreed on recourse to this Tribunal.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art27">Article 27</p>
    <p>The Signatory Powers consider it their duty, if a serious dispute threatens to break out between two or more of them, to remind these latter that the Permanent Court is open to them.</p>
    <p>Consequently, they declare that the fact of reminding the conflicting parties of the provisions of the present Convention, and the advice given to them, in the highest interests of peace, to have recourse to the Permanent Court, can only be regarded as friendly actions.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art28">Article 28</p>
    <p>A Permanent Administrative Council, composed of the Diplomatic Representatives of the Signatory Powers accredited to The Hague and of the Netherland Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will act as President, shall be instituted in this town as soon as possible after the ratification of the present Act by at least nine Powers.</p>
    <p>This Council will be charged with the establishment and organization of the International Bureau, which will be under its direction and control.</p>
    <p>It will notify to the Powers the constitution of the Court and will provide for its installation.</p>
    <p>It will settle its Rules of Procedure and all other necessary Regulations.</p>
    <p>It will decide all questions of administration which may arise with regard to the operations of the Court.</p>
    <p>It will have entire control over the appointment, suspension or dismissal of the officials and employ&eacute;s of the Bureau.</p>
    <p>It will fix the payments and salaries, and control the general expenditure.</p>
    <p>At meetings duly summoned the presence of five members is sufficient to render valid the discussions of the Council. The decisions are taken by a majority of votes.</p>
    <p>The Council communicates to the Signatory Powers without delay the Regulations adopted by it. It furnishes them with an annual Report on the labours of the Court, the working of the administration, and the expense.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art29">Article 29</p>
    <p>The expenses of the Bureau shall be borne by the Signatory Powers in the proportion fixed for the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" id="ch3"><span id="p240"><b><i>**240</i></b></span> <span class="sc">Chapter III.</span> <i>On Arbitral Procedure</i></p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art30">Article 30</p>
    <p>With a view to encourage the development of arbitration, the Signatory Powers have agreed on the following Rules which shall be applicable to arbitral procedure, unless other rules have been agreed on by the parties.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art31">Article 31</p>
    <p>The Powers who have recourse to arbitration sign a special Act (<i>compromis</i>), in which the subject of the difference is clearly defined, as well as the extent of the Arbitrators&rsquo; powers. This Act implies the undertaking of the parties to submit loyally to the award.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art32">Article 32</p>
    <p>The duties of Arbitrator may be conferred on one Arbitrator alone or on several Arbitrators selected by the parties as they please, or chosen by them from the  members of the permanent Court of Arbitration established by the present Act.</p>
    <p>Failing the constitution of the Tribunal by direct agreement between the parties, the following course shall be pursued:</p>
    <p>Each party appoints two arbitrators, and these latter together choose an Umpire.</p>
    <p>In case of equal voting, the choice of the Umpire is instructed to a third Power, selected by the parties by common accord.</p>
    <p>If no agreement is arrived at on this subject, each party selects a different Power, and the choice of the Umpire is made in concert by the Powers thus selected.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art33">Article 33</p>
    <p>When a Sovereign or the Chief of a State is chosen as Arbitrator, the arbitral procedure is settled by him.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art34">Article 34</p>
    <p>The Umpire is by right President of the Tribunal.</p>
    <p>When the Tribunal does not include an Umpire it appoints its own President.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art35">Article 35</p>
    <p>In case of the death, retirement, or disability from any cause of one of the Arbitrators, his place shall be filled in accordance with the method of his appointment.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art36">Article 36</p>
    <p>The Tribunal&rsquo;s place of session is selected by the parties. Failing this selection the Tribunal sits at The Hague.</p>
    <p>The place thus fixed cannot, except in case of necessity, be changed by the Tribunal without the assent of the parties.</p>

    <p>The parties have the right to appoint delegates or special agents to attend the Tribunal, for the purpose of serving as intermediaries between them and the Tribunal.</p>
    <p>They are further authorized to retain, for the defense of their rights and interests before the Tribunal, counsel or advocates appointed by them for this purpose.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art38">Article 38</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art39">Article 39</p>
    <p>As a general rule the arbitral procedure comprises two distinct phases: preliminary examination and discussion.</p>
    <p>Preliminary examination consists in the communication by the respective agents to the members of the Tribunal and to the opposite party of all printed of written Acts and of all documents containing the arguments invoked in the case. This communication shall be made in the form and within the periods fixed by the Tribunal in accordance with Article 49.</p>
    <p>Discussion consists in the oral development before the Tribunal of the arguments of the parties.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art40">Article 40</p>
    <p>Every document produced by one party must be communicated to the other party.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art41">Article 41</p>
    <p>The discussions are under the direction of the President.</p>
    <p>They are only public if it be so decided by the Tribunal, with the assent of the parties.</p>
    <p>They are recorded in the proc&egrave;s-verbaux drawn up by the Secretaries appointed by the President. These proc&egrave;s-verbaux alone have an authentic character.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art42">Article 42</p>
    <p>When the preliminary examination is concluded, the Tribunal has the right to refuse discussion of all fresh Acts or documents which one party may desire to submit to it without the consent of the other party.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art43">Article 43</p>
    <p>The Tribunal is free to take into consideration fresh Acts or documents to which its attention may be drawn by the agents or counsel of the parties.</p>
    <p>In this case, the Tribunal has the right to require the production of these Acts or documents, but is obliged to make them known to the opposite party.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art44"><span id="p242"><b><i>**242</i></b></span> Article 44</p>
    <p>The Tribunal can, besides, require from the agents of the parties the production of all Act, and can demand all necessary explanations. In case of refusal, the Tribunal takes note of it.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art45">Article 45</p>
    <p>The agents and counsel of the parties are authorized to present orally to the Tribunal all the arguments they may think expedient in defence of their case.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art46">Article 46</p>
    <p>They have the right to raise objections and points. The decisions of the Tribunal on those points are final, and can not form the subject of any subsequent discussion</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art47">Article 47</p>
    <p>The members of the Tribunal have the right to put questions to the agents and counsel of the parties, and to demand explanations from them on doubtful points.</p>
    <p>Neither the questions put nor the remarks made by members of the Tribunal during the discussions can be regarded as an expression of opinion by the Tribunal in general, or by its members in particular.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art48">Article 48</p>
    <p>The Tribunal is authorized to declare its competence in interpreting the <i>compromis</i> as well as the other Treaties which may be invoked in the case, and in applying the principles of international law.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art49">Article 49</p>
    <p>The Tribunal has the right to issue Rules of Procedure for the conduct of the case, to decide the forms and periods within which each party must conclude its arguments, and to arrange all the formalities required for dealing with the evidence.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art50">Article 50</p>
    <p>When the agents and counsel of the parties have submitted all explanations and evidence in support of their case, the president pronounces the discussion closed.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="51">Article 51</p>
    <p>The deliberations of the Tribunal take place in private. Every decision is taken by a majority of members of the Tribunal.</p>
    <p>The refusal of a member to vote must be recorded in the proc&egrave;s-verbal.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art52"><span id="p243"><b><i>**243</i></b></span> Article 52</p>
    <p>The award, given by a majority of votes, is accompanied by a statement of reasons. It is drawn up in writing and signed by each member of the Tribunal.</p>
    <p>Those members who are in the minority may record their dissent when signing.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art53">Article 53</p>
    <p>The award is read out at a public meeting of the Tribunal, the agents and counsel of the parties being present, or duly summoned to attend.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art54">Article 54</p>
    <p>The award, duly pronounced and notified to the agents of the parties at variance, puts an end to the dispute definitively and without appeal.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art55">Article 55</p>
    <p>The parties can reserve in the <i>compromis</i> the right to demand the revision of the award.</p>
    <p>In this case, and unless there be an agreement to the contrary, the demand must be addressed to the Tribunal which pronounced the award. It can only be made on the ground of the discovery of some new fact calculated to exercise a decisive influence on the award, and which, at the time the discussion was closed, was unknown to the Tribunal and to the party demanding the revision.</p>
    <p>Proceedings for revision can only be instituted by a decision of the Tribunal expressly recording the existence of the new fact, recognizing in it the character described in the foregoing paragraph, and declaring the demand admissible on this ground.</p>
    <p>The <i>compromis</i> fixes the period within which the demand for revision must be made.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art56">Article 56</p>
    <p>The award is only binding on the parties who concluded the <i>compromis</i>.</p>
    <p>When there is a question of interpreting a Convention to which Powers other than those concerned in the dispute are parties, the latter notify to the former the <i>compromis</i> they have concluded. Each of these Powers has the right to intervene in the case. If one or more of them avail themselves of this right, the interpretation contained in the award is equally binding on them.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center" class="sc" id="art57">Article 57</p>
    <p>Each party pays its own expenses and an equal share of those of the Tribunal.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span id="p244"><b><i>**244</i></b></span> <i>General provisions</i></p>

    <p>The Administrative Council of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, at its meeting on Mar. 3, 1960, having consulted all parties to the Hague conventions on pacific settlement of international disputes, in conformity with provisions of article 60, decided that after Mar. 15, 1960, the Netherlands Government would invite members of the United Nations which did not participate in the activities of the Permanent Court of Arbitration to declare (1) whether they considered themselves as contracting parties to the 1899 or 1907 Hague conventions on pacific settlement, or, if this were not the case, (2) whether they were <b><i>**245</i></b> willing to adhere to these conventions or to one of them. Several members of the United Nations responded to the invitation.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nothing contained in this convention shall be so construed as to require the United States of America to depart from its traditional policy of not intruding upon, interfering with, or entangling itself in the political questions of policy or internal administration of any foreign state; nor shall anything contained in the said convention be construed to imply a relinquishment by the United States of America of its traditional attitude toward purely American questions.&rdquo;</p>
