    <p>And whereas by an Order in Council bearing date this day, provision has been made for the exercise of His Majesty&rsquo;s jurisdiction in the territories to be known in future as the Protectorate of Nigeria;</p>
    <p>And whereas it is expedient to make provision for the establishment of an advisory and deliberate body, to be known as the Nigerian Council:</p>
    <p>Now, therefore, His Majesty, by virtue and in exercise of the powers by &ldquo;The Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn*" id="ffn*">*</a></sup> or otherwise in His Majesty vested, is pleased, by and with the advice and consent of his Privy Council, to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>Four European members, nominated by the Governor, and <b>*585</b> representative, as far as may be, of the commerce, shipping, mining, and banking of Nigeria</p>
    <p>Six native members, nominated by the Governor, and representative, as far as may be, of the native population, both of the coast and of the interior.</p>
    <p>5. Whenever upon any special occasion the Governor wishes to obtain the advice of any person within Nigeria, touching any matters about to be brought before the Council, he may, by an instrument under the public seal of Nigeria, appoint any such person to be, for such occasion, an extraordinary member of the Council.</p>
    <p>6. Every unofficial member of the Council shall be appointed by an instrument under the public seal of Nigeria, and his appointment shall be subject to His Majesty&rsquo;s approval, conveyed through a Secretary of State. Every such unofficial member shall vacate his seat at the end of four years from the date of the instrument by which he is appointed, unless it is otherwise provided by that instrument, but he shall be eligible to be reappointed by the Governor, by an instrument under the public seal of Nigeria, for a further period not exceeding for years, subject to the approval of His Majesty, conveyed through a Secretary of State.</p>

If any member of the Council, not holding one of the offices mentioned in the 4th clause of this Order, shall die, or become incapable of discharging his functions as a member of the Council, or be suspended or removed from this seat in the Council, or be absent from Nigeria, or if he resigns by writing under his hand, or if his seat become vacant, the Governor may, by an instrument under the public seal of Nigeria, appoint his place a fit person to be provisionally a member of the Council.</p>
    <p>Such person shall forthwith cease to be a member if his appointment is disallowed by His Majesty, or if the member in whose place he was appointed shall return to Nigeria, or, as the case may be, shall be released from suspension, or shall be declared by the Governor capable of again discharging his functions in the Council.</p>
    <p>The Governor shall, without delay, report to His Majesty for his confirmation or disallowance, signified through a Secretary of State, every provisional appointment of any person as an official or unofficial member of the Council.

    <p>8.

    <p>11. The official members of the Council shall take precedence of the unofficial members; and among themselves shall take precedence as His Majesty may specially assign, and, in default thereof, first the above-mentioned officers in the order in which their respective offices are mentioned, and, among officers of the same class, according to the seniority in that class; then other official members, and all unofficial members according to the priority of their respective appointments, or, if appointed by the same instrument, according to the order in which they ware named therein; and finally, extraordinary members according to the like priority. Every unofficial member of the Council reappointed immediately on the termination of his term of office shall take precedence according to the date from which he has been continuously a member of the Council.</p>
    <p>12. It shall be lawful for the Governor for good cause to suspend any member from being a member of the Council until His Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure be known, and any such suspension shall be at once reported to His Majesty through a Secretary of State, with a full statement of the reasons thereof. If the suspension is confirmed, the Governor shall forthwith cause the member to be so informed, and thereupon his seat shall become vacant.</p>
    <p>13. The Council shall meet not less often than once in each calendar year at the seat of Government or at such other place as to the Governor may seem most convenient.</p>
    <p>14. The Governor shall preside in the Council, and in the absence of the Governor that member shall preside who is first in precedence of those present.</p>
    <p>15. The Governor may with the advice of the Council from time to time make, alter, revoke, or renew such standing Rules and Orders as may be necessary or convenient for the conduct of the proceedings of the Council.</p>
    <p>All such Rules and Orders, not being repugnant to this Order, or to any instructions which the Governor may receive from His Majesty through a Secretary of State, shall at all times be followed and observed, and shall be binding upon the said Council, unless the same or any of them shall be disallowed by His Majesty.</p>

Provided that any resolution or question which any member may propose to bring forward for debate shall be notified to the Governor at least ten days before the meeting of the Council; and the Governor may in his discretion direct that the resolution or question shall not be brought forward if in his opinion a discussion of the matter would tend to promote or encourage class or racial prejudice or otherwise be detrimental to the well-being of Nigeria.</p>
    <p>17. No resolution passed by the Council shall have any legislative or executive authority, and the Governor shall not be required to give effect to any such resolution unless he thinks fit and is authorized to do so.</p>
    <p>18. A record of all proceedings of the Council shall be kept, and shall be transmitted to His Majesty annually through a Secretary of State.</p>
    <p>19. This Order shall come into operation on the 1st day of January, 1914, and shall be published in the &ldquo;Government Gazette&rdquo;; and the Governor shall give directions for the publication of this Order at such places and in such manner and for such time or times as he thinks proper for giving due publicity thereto within Nigeria.</p>
    <p>20. His Majesty may from time to time revoke, alter, add to, or amend this Order.</p>
